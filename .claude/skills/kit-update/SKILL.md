description: "Update the kit installed in a project: record the current version, clear local kit edits, run the updater against the upstream or a local path, read the migration notes between versions, apply the required overlay changes, then render and validate. Use when a newer kit release exists, a migration note or fix is needed, or the user asks to update the kit."

# Update Kit

## Use When
- A newer kit release exists, or a fix the project needs has shipped upstream.
- The user asks to update the kit.

## Do Not Use When
- The project has no `.ai/kit/` → `kit-install`.
- You are in the kit repository itself → `release-cut` for versioning.
- The project needs a kit change that has not shipped → `kit-upstream-propose`.

## Inputs
- The source: `evolution.upstream` in the profile, or a local kit checkout path.
- The target ref: the latest release by default, or a tag or branch the user names, per «Consumer Updates» in [versioning.md](core/wiki/evolution/versioning.md).

## Steps
1. Read `.ai/kit/VERSION` and record it as the old version.
2. Start a task branch with `git-branch-start` from a clean working tree (`git status --short`), so the update lands as one reviewable change.
3. Run `agentkit.py check`. When it reports edits inside `.ai/kit/`, stop: carry each edit into `.ai/project/` or to `kit-upstream-propose`, and restore the original kit file only after the user confirms.
4. Run `agentkit.py update`, adding `--from <source>` only for a source other than `evolution.upstream` and `--ref <tag-or-branch>` only when the user chose a version other than the latest release, per «Update» in [installation.md](core/wiki/integration/installation.md). Record the version it reports installing.
5. Read every CHANGELOG section the command prints and list each migration note per «Migration Notes» in versioning.md.
6. Apply each migration step in order, editing `.ai/project/` only. Then `rg` the overlay for every renamed or removed name the notes list and fix any reference the steps missed.
7. Run `agentkit.py sync` to regenerate tool files for the new version, then `agentkit.py check`; fix every error in the overlay, never in `.ai/kit/`.
8. Run any verification the migration notes call for; when a note names a `commands.*` key that is empty, report the gap.
9. Commit with `git-commit` and open a pull request with `github-pr-create` when the user asks.

## Output
- Old and new version.
- Each migration note with the action taken, or the reason it was skipped.
- The `check` result and any kit defect routed to `kit-upstream-propose`.
