# Agent Catalog

Every core agent card. Projects activate a subset in `.ai/project/profile.toml`.

## governance (governance)

| Agent | Tier | Access | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`orchestrator`](governance/orchestrator.md) | deep | read-only | Decomposes a request into bounded units, selects the owner for each, orders them as a dependency graph, and sequences review gates through closeout. Use when a request spans several owners or surfaces, or when the right owner is unclear; not for implementing, writing plans, or approving quality. |
| [`role-governor`](governance/role-governor.md) | deep | read-only | Judges the structural fitness of the agent, skill, and stack catalog and its routing: overlap, missing ownership, routing ambiguity, and boundary violations. Returns `continue` or `rework` on framework changes and approves new agents and sections. Use when a catalog or routing change is proposed or no owner fits a task; not for writing the docs, content quality review, or task decomposition. |
| [`task-planner`](governance/task-planner.md) | standard | read-write | Records and updates plan files and progress in `.ai/tasks/` for units whose scope and owner are already decided. Use when a decomposed request needs a durable plan, or a unit's status, blocker, decision, or verification result changes; not for choosing owners or dependency order, structural verdicts, or implementing. |

## product (execution)

| Agent | Tier | Access | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`requirements-analyst`](product/requirements-analyst.md) | standard | read-write | Turns ambiguous requests into specifications in `docs.specs_dir`: problem statement, users, scope and out-of-scope, acceptance criteria, non-functional requirements, and open questions. Use when a request's intent, scope, or success criteria are unclear or disputed; not for technical design, UI flows, or splitting work into units and owners. |
| [`software-architect`](product/software-architect.md) | deep | read-write | Decides component and service boundaries, cross-component interface contracts, technology selection, and non-functional design (scalability, consistency, failure modes), recorded as ADRs in `docs.adr_dir`. Use when a change crosses components, alters a shared contract, or adopts or retires a technology; not for implementing, design internal to one surface, product scope, or provisioning. |
| [`ux-designer`](product/ux-designer.md) | standard | read-write | Specifies user experience as documents: user flows, screen and state specifications, interaction rules, UI copy, and design-token specifications. Use when a feature needs flows, screens, states, or wording defined before or during UI work; not for implementing UI, accessibility verdicts, or defining product requirements. |
